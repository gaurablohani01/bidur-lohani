        <h2 class="timeline-title">ðŸ“š Education</h2>
        <p>For me, learning has never been limited to a degree â€” itâ€™s a habit of mind. Whether through structured
            programs or self-guided exploration, I believe staying curious, adaptive, and open is the key to building
            something meaningful. Education is the start, but evolution comes from constant learning.</p>

                        <h3>School Leaving Certificate (SLC)</h3>
                        <p>I completed my SLC at a government school â€” a time when high academic scores were more
                            commonly associated with private institutions. In our batch, however, that expectation
                            quietly began to shift. A few of us, through consistent effort and mutual support, achieved
                            grades that stood out â€” not just for ourselves, but for what they meant in the broader
                            context of our schoolâ€™s journey.
                        </p> <br>
                        <p>It was a proud moment, not just personally, but collectively. That year became a small
                            turning point, helping the school gain renewed confidence and recognition in the community.
                            It also reminded me how much potential can emerge when commitment meets opportunity â€” no
                            matter the setting.

                        <h3>Higher Secondary Education (10+2) â€“ Science Stream</h3>

                        <p>I originally pursued my higher secondary studies in the Science stream, with subjects like
                            Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. However, during this time, I found myself increasingly
                            drawn to the dynamics of the business world â€” how companies operate, how markets evolve, and
                            how ideas turn into impact.
                        </p> <br>
                        <p>That curiosity steadily grew stronger than my interest in science, leading me to pivot toward
                            business education after my +2. It was a turning point where I chose to follow what
                            genuinely motivated me, and that decision has shaped the path I walk today.</p> <br>

                        <h3>Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA)</h3>
                        <p>My academic foundation in business began at Tribhuvan University, where I explored the core
                            areas of finance, operations, strategy, and organizational behavior. Graduating at the top
                            of my class, I developed not just technical knowledge but a way of thinking â€” structured,
                            purposeful, and adaptable.</p>
                        <p>Our BBA program wasnâ€™t just about lectures â€” it was a space where ideas were tested and
                            shared. I was actively involved in case study sessions, business planning exercises, and
                            discussions around Nepalâ€™s evolving stock market. We also had a student publication where I
                            contributed opinion pieces on business trends and challenges â€” an experience that
                            strengthened my ability to think critically and communicate thoughtfully.</p>
                        <p>Beyond academics, I engaged in applied learning â€” from strategic competitions to leading
                            campus initiatives as a Hult Prize Campus Director. These experiences shaped my belief that
                            education should go hand in hand with curiosity, collaboration, and real-world application.
